### Why am I doing this?
* To get better as a programmer and to be able to build things the right way. I believe building things continuously and consistently should definitely get my skills to a higher level. _Focusing for 6months could get you ahead by 5years_

### What skills are you looking to get?
* I really want to relearn everything I already know and try to be able to do things right(*TDD, frameworks, clean code etc*)

### What you won't see on here
* You won't see interviews, and client work. I will talk about the client work(enough to not get sued lol) and log that but the code for that won't be available as well as what exactly am doing, just the general tools and process.

### Whats the process?
* When I have little or no work, I'll continue learning/relearning VueJS, ReactJS/React Native, GraphQL, Golang, Javascript, Python and design. I am also interested in Machine Learning, Cloud development and getting very good at Data structures and Algorithms.
