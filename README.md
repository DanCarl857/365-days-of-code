# 365 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday 29 April, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on VueJS Basics, played around with some basic concepts and started a book. Intend to finish it this week.
Also, started a video course in VueJS
                      
**Thoughts:** Really loved my time with Vue and thinking of switching from Angular to Vue all together. Love the simplicity. Struggled to get planned work done due to issues with my ISP.
