### Being a perpetual learner

For the past 30 days I decided to write code for atleast 3hours everyday. 
Thus far I have been successful in doing that and have decided to go for a full year. 
During this period, I am working on personal projects, client projects and learning new stuff.
I am also relearning and improving my knowledge of programming languages and frameworks I already know.
Sometimes I'll just build stuff(when I have the time though ;-)).

Feel free to reach out to me for any questions, work or just to chat and collaborate together.
