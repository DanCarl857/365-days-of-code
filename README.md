### Day 0: Monday 29 April, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on VueJS Basics, played around with some basic concepts and started a book. Intend to finish it this week.
Also, started a video course in VueJS
                      
**Thoughts:** Really loved my time with Vue and thinking of switching from Angular to Vue all together. Love the simplicity. Struggled to get planned work done due to issues with my ISP.

### Day 10: Thursday 10 May, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today mostly spent time leading a workshop on React Native. So most of the participants were new to Javascript so we had a refresher of Javascript today.

**Thoughts:** Truth be told was hoping for a bit more advanced crowd, but well all in all its always good to share knowledge.

### Day 11: Friday 11 May, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today worked on a vanillaJS application with HTML and CSS. Was a fun little app and gave me ideas for 2 new mobile applications(_Hope I get around to finishing those_). Was Day2 of the react native workshop, I've been at. Today we worked on the basics of React Native(components, props, styling, project structure). Also worked on some Docker configurations for a friends platform he is launching. We also learnt about how to structure components and react native projects. Got extremely tired after the workshop and decided to get some rest.

**Thoughts:** Was happy I was able to learn a few things in VanillaJS, build an application with the workshop participants and even get some Docker/Docker-compose going. Wish I could do more.
